# Experimental method for inputting Czech characters with diacritics in a plain text editor – Psanii Notepad (2009)

The problem:

- Lots of Czech people prefer using the US English keyboard layout, especially programmers, IT people, and older computer users.
- The US keyboard layout has no way of inputting most Czech characters with diacritics (“accents”), forcing users to switch layouts often or type without diacritics.
- While the Czech language fares fairly well with removed diacritics, it still results in misunderstandings.

This was an experimental attempt at a remedy. The Czech pangram:

>Příliš žluťoučký kůň úpěl ďábelské ódy.

is then typed like so:

>Prriiliss zzluttoucckyy kuunn uuuppel ddaabelskee oody.

Note that Czech has 'ů' and the less common 'ú', requiring both 'uu' and 'uuu'.

This results in significantly more keystrokes – almost 49% more in case of the pangram, though I expect it to be much less in actual Czech text – but repeated keystrokes, not requiring reacquisition of the next key.

The efficiency or speed of this method has not been measured, as I personally use a customised Czech keyboard layout.

The provided editor, Psanii Notepad, is also an almost fully featured plain text editor, only missing print and replace.
